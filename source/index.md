# Introduction

Welcome to the cec-web API! cec-web is a bridge between [HDMI-CEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC) and a Go based REST API, purpose built for use with [Roomie Remote](http://roomieremote.com)

There are examples for all the API commands in both cURL and [property list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list) (for use with Roomie Remote) flavors. You can view code examples in the column to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right of that column.
