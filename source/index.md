# Introduction

Welcome to the cec-web API! cec-web is a bridge between HDMI-CEC and a Go based REST API, purpose built for use with [Roomie Remote](http://roomieremote.com)

There are examples for all the API commands in both shell and XML (which should really be used for plists in Roomie Remote). You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
